Installation is as easy as running a computer. You just need to install Nodejs with pnpm package manager.

But...

Let's do it like a **hacker**
```sh
# 1. Install brew: https://brew.sh/

# 2. Install node version manager
brew install n

# 3. Install latest node version
n lts

# 3. Install blazing package manager
brew install pnpm
```
Everything seems to be going well so far, _hehehe_ 

Moving forward
```sh
# 4. Install packages
pnpm i

# 5. Run application in dev mod && bon voyage to you
pnpm dev
```
